__bcc__ is an ACS compiler.

The Zandronum engine is used when developing the compiler, so the addition of a feature depends on the capabilities of the latest production release of said engine.

New features include:

* structs
* enums
* namespaces
* Proper scoping
* Optional function parameters
* __&&__ and __||__ operators now use short-circuit evaluation
* goto statement
* Format blocks

__Note:__ New features and their characteristics are subject to change until further notice.

Further detail about a feature is found in the [details.md](https://github.com/wormt/bcc/blob/master/details.md) file.
