__bcc__ is an ACS compiler.

The [Zandronum](http://zandronum.com/) engine is used when developing the compiler, so the addition of a feature depends on the capabilities of the latest production release of said engine.

New features include:

* <code>enum</code> declarations
* <code>struct</code> declarations
* <code>region</code> declarations
* Proper scoping
* Optional function parameters
* <code>&&</code> and <code>||</code> operators use short-circuit evaluation
* <code>goto</code> statement
* Format blocks

__Note:__ New features and their characteristics are subject to change until further notice.

More details about a feature are found in the [details](https://github.com/wormt/bcc/blob/master/details.md) file.
