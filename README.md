__bcc__ is an ACS/ACS95/BCS compiler.

BCS is mostly compatible with ACS and provides many extra features, including the following:

* Structures
* Enumerations
* Namespaces
* Preprocessor
* Strong types
* References (limited support)
* Block scoping
* Optional function parameters
* Logical-AND (`&&`) and Logical-OR (`||`) are short-circuited
* `foreach` loop
* Nested functions
* `?:` operator

See the [details](https://github.com/wormt/bcc/blob/bcs/doc/details.md) file for an overview of the features.
